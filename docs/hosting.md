What is VPS Hosting?
With a VPS the resources of the server will be split between different websites or hosting accounts. Think of it as a home computer that has many different users, all of who use the machine in different ways.

Virtual Private Servers have both high end and low end options available. However, the cost usually ranges from $20/month all the way up to $100+/month. VPS servers usually have one or two hosting environments you can choose from, so they lack the absolute customization of dedicated hosts. But, this does mean easier setup for those who have more basic websites.

This style of hosting will be enough for sites that are simpler and don’t receive massive amounts of traffic. Overall, you can think of VPS hosting as a perfect solution for those who require root access on a server, but don’t want the expense of a full dedicated server.

If basic shared hosting doesn’t quite offer what you need and you need a little more control over your host, then VPS hosting could be the right fit for you. If you need a more advanced host with extensive customization options, then check out dedicated hosting below.

What is Dedicated Hosting?
A dedicated server is a server that’s literally dedicated to your own personal use. You’ll have rights to all of the resources of the machine, and you’ll be able to configure the hosting environment however you wish.

Dedicated hosts are usually only worthwhile if you’re receiving over 500,000 visitors per month and have the necessary technical staff to maintain and optimize your server.

There is no right and wrong when it comes to hosting. Instead, it simply depends upon what’s the best choice for your website. We all have different needs. So make sure you take stock of what kind of hosting support you’ll need before you choose a web host.

However, since dedicated servers are almost always more expensive it’s generally a good idea to start with a VPS until your company is generating enough revenue to support the cost of a dedicated server.

==============================================================================================================================================================================

There are two flavors of VPS offered, and you need to be clear on which service you use. 

The first gives you a true virtual machine (meaning you can run anything you want and are basically root) and 
the second gives you a dedicated hosting control panel (like cPanel), but you share the core Web server configuration with other users on the machine.

VPS services are also shared. 

Going back to the "virtual" part, you might get a VPS that offers you a virtual machine image, onto which will likely be installed a Linux distro. 
After that, in many VM-based VPSs, you're on your own. ====> You need to load your own LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Perl) and set up your own server management. For those who want to spend less money but want full control over their environment, this is a good choice.
